# D3-Challenge

## Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables, Healthcare vs. Poverty.
Using the D3 techniques, we created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

- Included state abbreviations in the circles.


- Situated our axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

- Placed additional labels in our scatter plot so that your users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for our circles' locations, as well as the range of our axes.

- Added tooltips to our circles to display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
